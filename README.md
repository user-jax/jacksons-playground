# React TypeScript App with Material Tailwind

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) using the TypeScript template and enhanced with Material Tailwind for beautiful, modern UI components.

## Features

- ‚öõÔ∏è **React 19** with TypeScript
- üé® **Material Tailwind** for beautiful UI components
- üì± **Responsive Design** that works on all devices
- üöÄ **Modern Development** with hot reloading
- üéØ **Type Safety** with TypeScript

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or navigate to the project directory
2. Install dependencies:

## Project Structure

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App.tsx          # Main application component
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.tsx        # Application entry point

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **TypeScript**: Adds static typing to JavaScript
- **Material Tailwind**: Beautiful UI components built on top of Tailwind CSS
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework

## Customization

### Adding New Components

You can create new components in the `src/components/` directory and import them into your App.tsx file.

### Styling

The app uses Tailwind CSS for styling. You can:
- Modify the `tailwind.config.js` file to customize the design system
- Add custom CSS in `src/index.css`
- Use Material Tailwind components for consistent design

### Material Tailwind Components

The app is set up to use Material Tailwind components. You can import and use them like this:

```tsx
import { Button, Card, Typography } from "@material-tailwind/react";

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Card>
      <Typography variant="h5">Hello World</Typography>
      <Button>Click me</Button>
    </Card>
  );
}
```
